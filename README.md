# Docling-LangGraph-ChromaDB-RAG-app

> A hybrid document QA pipeline powered by OCR, Docling, LangChain, LangGraph, and ChromaDB.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Original Author

This project was originally authored by **Hailey T. Quach** as part of IBM‚Äôs work on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using LangGraph. You can find the original repository at:  
üëâ [https://github.com/HaileyTQuach/docchat-docling](https://github.com/HaileyTQuach/docchat-docling)

The original codebase integrates IBM technologies and open-source LLM ecosystem tools to support multi-agent document question answering.

## üîÑ Fork Purpose

This fork builds on Hailey‚Äôs foundational work, with the goal of:

- **Customizing the RAG pipeline** for QA use cases involving scanned or structured documents
- Adding **OCR and scanned PDF processing** support with Docling
- Exploring **LangGraph** for agent workflows
- Using **ChromaDB** for hybrid semantic + keyword search
- Integrating **secure `.env`-free public workflows**

---

## üì¶ Components

- `Docling`: For OCR and PDF-to-Markdown/JSON conversion
- `LangGraph`: Agent graph coordination framework
- `LangChain`: LLM tools and chain utilities
- `ChromaDB`: Fast vector and keyword search backend
- `Gradio`: Simple UI interface for QA demo
